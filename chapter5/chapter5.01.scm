;; register machine -- a model for modern computers
;;
;; has a fixed set of storage elements, called registers
;;
;; sequentially executes instructions that manimulate those registers

;;
;; whereas addition and multiplication can be easily implemented in
;; hardware, such operations as car, cdr, and cons need to know more
;; about memory and how to allocate it
;;

;;
;; The remainder machine: data paths controlled by buttons plus
;; controller that pushes the buttons

;; Registers: iter, product, counter, a (for mul), b (for add), n
;;
;; Operations: mul, add

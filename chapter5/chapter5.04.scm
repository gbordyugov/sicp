;; started Chapter 5.4 The Explicit-Control Evaluator
;;

;;
;; Aim of this chapter: show how implement the abstraction of
;; procedure definition and calling using register machines
;;

;;
;; Registers and Operations

;;
;; Scheme evaluator includes a stack plus the registers: exp, env,
;; val, continue, proc, arg1, and unev.
;;
;; exp is used to hold the expression to be evaluated
;; env holds the corresponding environment
;; val contains the value obtained by evaluating the expression in the
;;     designed environment
;; continue register is used to implement recursion in the evaluator
;;     itself
;; proc, arg1, and unev are used in evaluating combinations.

ev-self-eval

  (goto (reg continue))

ev-variable
  (assign val (op lookup-variable-value) (reg exp) (reg env))
  (goto (reg continue))

ev-quoted
  (assign val (op text-of-quotation) (reg exp))
  (goto (reg continue))

ev-lambda
  (assign unev (op lambda-parameters) (reg exp))
  (assign exp (op lambda-body) (reg exp))
  (assign val (op make-procedure) (reg unev) (reg exp) (reg env))
  (goto (reg continue))

;; observe that unev and exp hold the parameters and the body of the
;; lambda expression so that they can be passed to make-procedure,
;; along with the environment in env

;;
;; Evaluating procedure application
;;

;;
;; the explicit-control evaluator first evaluates the arguments of the
;; procedure by calling itself in a recursive manner.

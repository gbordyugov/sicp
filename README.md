My read through Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
=================================================================

Open/skipped exercises:
 - 1.28
 - 2.16
 - comparison of time complexitity of the fast and the slow
   eight-queens puzzle in exercise 2.43
 - d) of 2.49 (the `wave` painter)
 - 2.52
 - 2.58 (b) (a beautiful one, must do it later!)
 - 2.92
 - 2.95
 - 4.10 (is a larger project)
 - 4.31
 - 4.67 (on the first pass before Section 4.4.4 where the system is
   implemented)
 - 4.69 needs to be revisited after Section 4.4.4 is done
 - 4.76-4.79 - I think I've spent enough time with the query language
 - 5.23-5.52 from here on, I'm skipping the rest of the exercises

-----------------------------

I feel that working with the explicit-control evaluator and the
compiler becomes too involving, so I'm just reading the rest of the
book, starting from the end of Chapter 5.4. A total of 12+4+29 = 45
out of 356 exercises skipped, which means that more than 87% of
exercises have been completed.

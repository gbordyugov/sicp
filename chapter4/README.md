Chapter 4: Metalinguistic Abstraction (aka A Bunch of Interpreters)
===================================================================

`chapter4.01.scm` represents a first pass of the subsection, is buggy
and wouldn't run.

`simple-interpreter.scm` is my second pass through Chapter 4.1 and
seems less buggy and sometimes does what expected.

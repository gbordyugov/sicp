Chapter 4: Metalinguistic Abstraction (aka A Bunch of Interpreters)
===================================================================

`chapter4.01.scm` represents a first pass of the subsection, is buggy
and wouldn't run.

`simple-interpreter.scm` plus `analyzing-interpreter.scm' represent my
second pass through Chapter 4.1 and seems less buggy and sometimes
does what expected.

'lazy-interpreter.scm` is second pass through Chapter 4.2

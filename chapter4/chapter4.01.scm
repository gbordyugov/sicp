;; evaluator: a procedure that, when applied to an expression,
;; performs the actions required to evaluate that expression
;;

;;
;; the most fundamental idea in programming:
;;
;; The evaluator, which determines the meaning of expressions in a
;; programming language, is just another program
;;

;;
;; (the real ;) programmers are designers of languages, rather than
;; only users of languages designed by others
